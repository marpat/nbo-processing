NBO Processing scripts
================

This area contains a variety of scripts for processing output txt files. 
Those output files originate from computational chemistry runs, notably from the Natural Bond Orbital (NBO) 
analysis of molecular properties.

To copy scripts and associated files to your computer, either:

+    Clone the repository to your computer ("Clone in Desktop")
+    Download ZIP package file and unpack
